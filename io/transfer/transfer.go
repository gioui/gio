// Package transfer contains operations and events for brokering data transfers.
//
// The transfer protocol is as follows:
//
//   - Data sources are registered with SourceOps, data targets with TargetOps.
//   - A data source receives a RequestEvent when a transfer is initiated.
//     It must respond with an OfferOp.
//   - The target receives a DataEvent when transferring to it. It must close
//     the event data after use.
//
// When a user initiates a pointer-guided drag and drop transfer, the
// source as well as all potential targets receive an InitiateEvent.
// Potential targets are targets with at least one MIME type in common
// with the source. When a drag gesture completes, a CancelEvent is sent
// to the source and all potential targets.
//
// Note that the RequestEvent is sent to the source upon drop.
